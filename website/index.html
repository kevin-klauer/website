    <h1>Guten Tag</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Kevin, currently working as a Solution Expert, DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer/Architect. Call it what you want.

        <p>
            This site is a <b>work in progress</b> (like my cooking skills).
        </p>
        <p>
            I have no clue what I am doing here yet. 
            Maybe a personal blog? Tech rants? Book reviews? Sport updates? My personal records? Who knows!
        </p>
        <p>
            Stay tuned for more chaos and possibly (not) useful content.
